# Credit

Big thanks to https://github.com/gsingh93/display-manager/tree/master for the main outline for using pam and https://gsgx.me/posts/how-to-write-a-display-manager/. I rewrote a large portion of their code for use in this project

# Requirements

This requires the libpam-dev, libgtk-4-dev package to be installed

# Compilation

As usual, use `make micro-display-mgr` to make the main executable.
